1
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:13,158
<i>I wonder
what that rain tastes like.</i>

2
00:01:14,076 --> 00:01:16,495
I used to love the rain
when I was a kid.

3
00:01:17,412 --> 00:01:21,375
I used to sit out here
and watch the lightning storms.

4
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,543
<i>That sounds beautiful.</i>

5
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:28,715
<i>Okay, so what do we got here?</i>

6
00:01:29,758 --> 00:01:31,593
<i>What am I reaching for?</i>

7
00:01:32,052 --> 00:01:35,639
<i>I'll reach wherever
the fuck I wanna reach, motherfucker.</i>

8
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:40,686
<i>I'm like some bad virus
you just can't shake.</i>

9
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:44,064
<i>Okay.</i>

10
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:45,857
<i>So, what do we got here?</i>

11
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,193
<i>Fuckin' stay out of my head!</i>

12
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:50,112
<i>You're welcome, kid.</i>

13
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:54,825
<i>So, what do we got here?</i>

14
00:01:54,908 --> 00:01:56,785
<i>We reach out and reach out,</i>

15
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:59,496
<i>and flippin' and flippin' the switches
like a goddamn monkey</i>

16
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,832
<i>to see if something clicks. Huh.</i>

17
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:05,585
<i>Now, where I come from,
we call that a clue.</i>

18
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:08,422
Where the hell have you been?

19
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:11,758
<i>Fuck being fired, boss. I quit.</i>

20
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:20,517
What the fuck was that?

21
00:02:21,852 --> 00:02:23,145
Am I talking?

22
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:25,439
God. Can you hear me?

23
00:02:25,522 --> 00:02:27,858
Yeah! I can hear you.

24
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:32,779
Thank Christ.

25
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:36,992
Well, I seem to be holding together
pretty good right now.

26
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:40,036
I... I call that a win.

27
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,788
Where the hell have you been?

28
00:02:41,872 --> 00:02:43,415
I've been here
the whole time.

29
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:44,958
Why wouldn't you just talk to me?

30
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,042
It's not that easy.

31
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,879
- No hat?
- It's not my hat.

32
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:52,758
That hat belongs to the Investigator

33
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:55,594
that the protomolecule
keeps making out of my corpse

34
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:58,764
over and over and over again.

35
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:00,515
It couldn't kill me this time.

36
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:02,893
But we might not have long.

37
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:08,064
I... I brought my crew out here
because I thought we were helping you,

38
00:03:08,148 --> 00:03:10,192
not the protomolecule
wearing a Miller suite.

39
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:13,069
The protomolecule's
been using us both, pal.

40
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:16,072
But being inside your head,

41
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:18,158
watching you give a shit,

42
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:21,703
you helped me,

43
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:23,622
gave me something
to build on, you know?

44
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:26,333
You helped me outsmart the jailer.

45
00:03:28,794 --> 00:03:29,795
Welcome back.

46
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:32,297
So, what happens now?

47
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:36,092
I found something.

48
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:38,720
Not what it wanted me to find.

49
00:03:38,804 --> 00:03:40,680
No. Something else.

50
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:43,016
See, I've been flicking switches.

51
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:45,101
I've been turning on
everything they left behind...

52
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:46,561
And almost killing everyone.

53
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:48,855
Eh, I didn't have much control
over that part, okay?

54
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:52,108
But it was important,
because I found a place

55
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,110
that my new bosses can't go.

56
00:03:54,945 --> 00:03:58,198
Every time I reach out,
that part withers...

57
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:01,159
Dies.

58
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:03,662
If it shuts down
whatever's trapping us here,

59
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:04,955
that'd be a start.

60
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:07,707
This planet's already a corpse.

61
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:13,296
Let's go kill its ghost.

62
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:21,847
<i>I wish I was down there.</i>

63
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,559
Have we talked about the slugs
covered in neurotoxin,

64
00:04:25,642 --> 00:04:26,935
and the ocular parasites?

65
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:28,979
<i>Well,
there is no restarting the reactor,</i>

66
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:31,314
<i>so I got a decaying orbit
and a fiery death up here.</i>

67
00:04:31,398 --> 00:04:33,525
<i>Don't act like you're special.</i>

68
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:35,902
<i>But if we're all gonna die
up here and down there,</i>

69
00:04:35,986 --> 00:04:37,654
<i>I wish I was with you.</i>

70
00:04:37,737 --> 00:04:39,656
<i>With a friend, I mean.</i>

71
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:42,325
I do know what you mean.

72
00:04:47,706 --> 00:04:48,707
Let me call you back.

73
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:52,168
But how can we be sure

74
00:04:52,252 --> 00:04:54,671
this spot is some sort
of a magic bullet?

75
00:04:57,674 --> 00:05:00,969
What are the odds it's just
another root stuck in the wall?

76
00:05:04,264 --> 00:05:06,308
So,
there was a war here, right,

77
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:08,351
between the beings
that made the protomolecule

78
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:09,686
and something even worse.

79
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:11,021
I know. I've seen them.

80
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:13,398
Well, we won't know for sure
until we get there,

81
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:15,150
but this place, this dead spot,

82
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:17,736
may mean that the war
left something behind.

83
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:21,156
What?

84
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:23,950
Something like a billion-year-old
unexploded bomb?

85
00:05:24,034 --> 00:05:25,201
Yeah, something like that.

86
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:28,121
See, this bomb, if it exists,

87
00:05:28,872 --> 00:05:31,249
kills every bit
of protomolecule it touches.

88
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,961
And right now, that's what I need.

89
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:36,671
- And I wanna help you.
- Come on.

90
00:05:36,755 --> 00:05:38,298
Everything I've done
over the last year

91
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:39,382
has been to help you,

92
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:41,801
even if it meant looking crazy
in front of everyone.

93
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:45,847
Well, I know it ain't been easy
lugging me around in your skull.

94
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:47,766
Well, we all owe you. I owe you.

95
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:49,225
But it's not just me.

96
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:52,312
I also need to get everyone away
from this place alive.

97
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:55,023
Help me save the ships first.
Then I'll do whatever you need.

98
00:05:55,357 --> 00:05:57,692
You ever met anybody
you didn't wanna save?

99
00:05:58,777 --> 00:06:00,278
Look, maybe this does both.

100
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:03,198
Bomb works, I'll use it to kill
all the protomolecule on the planet.

101
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:04,783
Your ships go free.

102
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,162
You're sure you can do that
without killing us all?

103
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:11,081
No.

104
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:14,042
But the other option is,

105
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:18,046
well, you watch everyone
starve to death while your ships burn,

106
00:06:19,506 --> 00:06:23,551
and I get trapped here forever,
looking for something I'll never find.

107
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:25,470
So...

108
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:41,695
<i>Bought ourselves a little time,
but not much.</i>

109
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:44,864
We're scraping more atmosphere
than we calculated at this altitude.

110
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:46,700
<i>How's the tether holding up?</i>

111
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,077
More oscillation in the line
than I hoped.

112
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,037
<i>I'm seeing increased drag, too.</i>

113
00:06:51,121 --> 00:06:52,706
Can we give the Barb another boost?

114
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:54,124
<i>Yeah, we're gonna have to.</i>

115
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,875
Hold on.

116
00:06:56,251 --> 00:06:57,836
Barbapiccola, are you there?

117
00:06:58,712 --> 00:06:59,754
Here.

118
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:02,340
<i>We are picking up more drag
than expected.</i>

119
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:04,217
<i>We're going to do another burn.</i>

120
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,886
Give us two minutes
to brace and make safe.

121
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,221
<i>Copy that.</i>

122
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:13,226
<i>All hands prepare
for orbital correction.</i>

123
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:15,562
How many more of these burns
can we afford?

124
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:17,731
Batteries will give us five, maybe.

125
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:20,984
Close off any unused compartments
and shut down air recycling to them.

126
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,277
That's not gonna buy us much.

127
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,445
<i>Just do it.</i>

128
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:24,863
<i>And kill water recycling.</i>

129
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,656
Thrusters don't like dirty water.

130
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:28,742
Well, let me know
if the tank gets that low.

131
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:29,826
<i>All right.</i>

132
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,870
<i>You know...</i>

133
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:34,748
If they dump their ore,
reduce their mass,

134
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:36,541
we could get it as high
as seven or eight.

135
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:40,295
We're not there yet.

136
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:41,838
Copy that.

137
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:43,965
<i>The Rocinante has attached</i>

138
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:46,843
<i>what appears to be a towing system
to the Barbapiccola.</i>

139
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:48,511
How much time is that giving them?

140
00:07:48,595 --> 00:07:49,929
<i>They just did another burn.</i>

141
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:51,556
<i>Orbital model says
they bought the Barb</i>

142
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,807
<i>another 20 hours at least.</i>

143
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:56,728
How many of these burns
can the Roci do?

144
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:59,689
<i>I don't know, but if they're
tethered, they're very vulnerable.</i>

145
00:07:59,773 --> 00:08:01,858
<i>If you're gonna use that shuttle
and take them out...</i>

146
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:02,942
Understood.

147
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:10,909
It's okay, little man.

148
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:12,994
You can sleep.

149
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:15,955
So, we go back to the surface?

150
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:17,791
Then what? We starve?

151
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:19,542
You wanna stay here with those...

152
00:08:21,878 --> 00:08:23,838
I'll be right here
when you wake up, huh?

153
00:08:24,756 --> 00:08:26,299
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

154
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:28,468
One, two, three.

155
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:41,648
You doing all right?

156
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:45,193
Everything still looks
a little green, but yeah.

157
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,945
- You?
- Same.

158
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:48,363
So, that bullet's dodged.

159
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:49,823
The next problem's gonna be food.

160
00:08:49,906 --> 00:08:52,575
Some of these people are gonna
starve to death before help comes.

161
00:08:53,076 --> 00:08:54,577
Is there something you're telling me?

162
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:57,122
I'm just inviting you to come
camp with me. Our camp, not...

163
00:08:57,205 --> 00:08:59,415
Does your boss know
that you're asking me to sleep over?

164
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:01,334
What is it with you two?

165
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,962
Is this some jealousy thing?
Because Murtry and I never...

166
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:06,214
I didn't ask, and I don't care.

167
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:08,883
He just reminds me of some of the guys
that I grew up with.

168
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:11,511
Well, you should give him a chance.
He's a pragmatist like you.

169
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:12,929
And he's good to his people.

170
00:09:13,513 --> 00:09:14,973
Just because someone is good to you,

171
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:16,808
it doesn't mean
that you can trust them.

172
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:18,351
I do trust him.

173
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:21,479
And you guys don't like each other
because you're exactly fucking alike.

174
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:22,730
I'd never lie to you.

175
00:09:39,998 --> 00:09:41,207
Fuck.

176
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,500
Oh, fuck.

177
00:09:43,877 --> 00:09:46,796
You're tired?
I'm doing all the work here.

178
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,883
I've been awake
for three days straight.

179
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:51,843
So, yeah, I'm fucking tired.

180
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:54,512
Yeah, you and me both.

181
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:56,514
And thin.

182
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:59,976
It's like every time they rip me apart
and paste me back together again,

183
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:01,686
there's a little less of me
to work with.

184
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:03,980
Jesus.

185
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:09,611
One foot in front of the other
until we make it,

186
00:10:09,694 --> 00:10:11,863
or we die trying, hmm?

187
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:14,741
That's a hell of a pep talk.

188
00:10:16,284 --> 00:10:17,368
You ready, or...

189
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:23,583
All right, now,
don't walk off that edge

190
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,418
till I get the thing turned on, okay?

191
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:28,504
Uh-huh.

192
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:31,758
Ah, okay.

193
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,260
You want me to climb down there?

194
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:36,346
Climb. Jump. Whatever.

195
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:37,889
Just get in the hole.

196
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:41,434
Go on. It won't hurt you.

197
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:55,198
Where does this go?

198
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:56,908
Closer to our bomb.

199
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:58,284
And it's faster than walking.

200
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:01,120
- So just, you know, jump in the hole.
- Holden.

201
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:05,833
You're not going in that, are you?

202
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:07,293
What are you doing here?

203
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:09,462
I heard you talking to no one.

204
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:11,798
That was him, right? Your ghost?

205
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:14,550
He's not a ghost,
but yes, that was Miller.

206
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:17,095
You were talking
about saving the ships.

207
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:18,179
Can he do that?

208
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:19,347
Maybe.

209
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,515
- I'll go with you.
- No.

210
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:22,100
- I can help.
- No, you can't.

211
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:23,810
My ship is going to burn, too.

212
00:11:24,102 --> 00:11:25,937
My people are going to die,
same as yours.

213
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,188
I have just as much to lose.

214
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:31,067
I can't see him when anyone's around,
and I need him to guide me.

215
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:32,694
Guide you to what?

216
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:35,405
If what I'm doing actually works,

217
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:37,198
everyone will know soon.

218
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:11,941
Report on the Belter camp?

219
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:14,444
They're not hungry enough yet
to be a threat. Why?

220
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:15,903
Situation in orbit has changed.

221
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:18,781
We're gonna need
to take action down here, and soon.

222
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:20,825
They don't maintain a perimeter
or an armed watch

223
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,327
unless you count Amos.

224
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,453
Do you?

225
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:28,958
I'm gonna need location
on Amos and Holden now.

226
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:32,462
Everyone check in.
We need eyes on Holden.

227
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:34,005
<i>Copy that.</i>

228
00:12:35,173 --> 00:12:36,341
Dr. Okoye,

229
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:39,469
I'm gonna need all RCE personnel
to stay within our camp.

230
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:40,595
What? Why?

231
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:41,929
For your safety.

232
00:12:42,472 --> 00:12:44,057
No one has eyes on Holden.

233
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,311
You were rather friendly with him.

234
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:50,772
You wouldn't have any idea
where he might be, do you?

235
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:54,817
I don't know where he is right now.

236
00:12:56,694 --> 00:12:58,321
This is very important.

237
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,825
I need to know
where Captain Holden has gone.

238
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:05,912
And if you know anything about that,
you're going to tell me.

239
00:13:06,496 --> 00:13:07,497
Right now.

240
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,219
<i>Light shuttle two
is cleared for launch.</i>

241
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:29,685
Why are we launching a shuttle?
Missed what happened to the last one?

242
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:31,062
Security division's authority.

243
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:33,523
To do what? Get our last shuttle
ripped to shreds?

244
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:35,566
We still have people
who will someday want a ride.

245
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,568
- Chief Murtry's orders.
- Why would he even...

246
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:39,946
If you don't already know,
it's not your business.

247
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:42,657
Now, sit the fuck down and go back
to doing whatever it is you do.

248
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:49,539
Okay.

249
00:13:51,082 --> 00:13:52,083
No problem.

250
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,422
- Okoye here.
- Hey, give me that.

251
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:40,798
I need to take this call.

252
00:14:40,882 --> 00:14:42,800
Murtry says no communications.

253
00:14:44,886 --> 00:14:46,804
Hey, Doc, you seen Wei?

254
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:49,348
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No one's allowed
to talk to her, all right?

255
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:55,646
I wouldn't.

256
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:59,233
All right. What the fuck's going on?

257
00:14:59,317 --> 00:15:00,943
Holden went with Miller.

258
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:03,237
Murtry and Wei went after him.
I think he's in trouble.

259
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,535
Is there something
we still need to do?

260
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,709
Shit.

261
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:21,839
Amos.

262
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:23,591
<i>Can you get a fix
on the captain?</i>

263
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,471
<i>I'm not getting a signal.</i>

264
00:15:29,222 --> 00:15:31,182
Okay, if he checks in,
tell him I'm coming,

265
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:32,642
<i>and that he should watch his back.</i>

266
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:34,769
- Is something going on down there?
- Yup.

267
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,521
<i>- Anything I can do?</i>
- No.

268
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:43,736
All right, show me where Holden went.

269
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:50,535
Wei, I'm coming for your boss.

270
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,537
Don't be there when I do.

271
00:16:03,673 --> 00:16:05,216
<i>Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.</i>

272
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:11,889
Miller!

273
00:16:13,975 --> 00:16:17,061
Where the fuck are you? What do I do?

274
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:34,704
Nice nap?

275
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,214
Man, play with the toys later.

276
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,009
- What now?
- We take a walk.

277
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:51,762
All this shit's left over
from when the planet died.

278
00:16:52,722 --> 00:16:54,140
Yeah, everything they left behind.

279
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:57,602
This shit just keeps following you
around, don't it, kid?

280
00:16:59,312 --> 00:17:00,313
Come on.

281
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:04,150
Stay out of my head, assholes!

282
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,611
Are you okay?

283
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,030
Yeah, I'm fine.

284
00:17:10,573 --> 00:17:13,034
It's just my former masters
cracking the whip,

285
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:14,869
wondering why I don't jump.

286
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:18,372
Yeah, they're looking
for a way back in.

287
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,499
Is there anything I can do?

288
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,043
Yeah.

289
00:17:22,126 --> 00:17:24,587
Why don't we try
killing 'em off for good,

290
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,255
see how that works?

291
00:17:34,764 --> 00:17:36,766
- You're going to follow them.
- I am.

292
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,061
I'm going with you.
Don't try to stop me.

293
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:42,021
You don't need my permission.

294
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,024
But it might be a one-way trip, Doc.

295
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,527
We are already on one.

296
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:01,540
The cable's too elastic.

297
00:18:01,624 --> 00:18:03,376
It's stretching under the stress.

298
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:04,960
I can take up the slack here.

299
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:06,253
<i>No.</i>

300
00:18:06,337 --> 00:18:09,006
Better if I put some tension
on the cable from this end.

301
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,841
<i>No more than a quarter turn.</i>

302
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,468
<i>More might snap it.</i>

303
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:13,552
Okay.

304
00:18:14,512 --> 00:18:15,763
Here goes.

305
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:33,656
Shit.

306
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:38,285
Hmm.

307
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:42,039
Why text?

308
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:51,340
No, I did not.

309
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,259
What the hell is he up to now?

310
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:16,240
Thanks for the heads-up.

311
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:21,454
Edward Israel light shuttle,
this is the Rocinante.

312
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:23,622
Appears you're on
a potential collision course.

313
00:19:23,706 --> 00:19:25,291
Please respond immediately.

314
00:19:30,004 --> 00:19:31,284
Edward Israel,

315
00:19:31,297 --> 00:19:33,340
this is Alex Kamal of the Rocinante.

316
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:35,342
<i>This is the Edward Israel.</i>

317
00:19:35,426 --> 00:19:36,427
<i>- Go ahead.</i>
- Yeah.

318
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,721
Any reason why your shuttle
is heading towards us?

319
00:19:39,764 --> 00:19:41,766
<i>Stand by, Rocinante.
Checking on that.</i>

320
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:48,481
Yeah, I'm gonna be needing
an answer to that right now.

321
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,278
- Naomi?
<i>- What's wrong?</i>

322
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:55,696
I think we might be under attack.

323
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,740
<i>- From what?</i>
- Brace for impact.

324
00:19:58,449 --> 00:19:59,533
Lucia, brace!

325
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:02,828
<i>RCE shuttle, pull off.</i>

326
00:20:02,912 --> 00:20:05,080
Change course immediately,
or I will fire.

327
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:18,052
<i>Look out, guys!
We've got debris incoming!</i>

328
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,683
Lucia!

329
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:26,977
<i>Naomi.</i>

330
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:28,854
<i>What the hell's going on
out there?</i>

331
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:32,942
<i>- Naomi!</i>
- I'm coming!

332
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,579
<i>Naomi, come in!</i>

333
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,697
Alex,
there's nothing you can do.

334
00:20:38,781 --> 00:20:40,699
Stay off this channel,
and do not spin the ship.

335
00:20:40,783 --> 00:20:41,784
<i>Copy that.</i>

336
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:44,043
That's it. Don't panic.

337
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:46,914
- I'm coming.
- Okay.

338
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,877
- I'm right here.
- Help, Naomi!

339
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,668
Stay calm.

340
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:56,484
- Yes, it's okay.
- I can't breathe. I can't...

341
00:20:56,507 --> 00:20:58,425
I'm just a few seconds
behind you, okay?

342
00:20:58,509 --> 00:20:59,909
- I can't...
- Just breathe.

343
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:01,367
I'm coming!

344
00:21:01,387 --> 00:21:02,972
Naomi!

345
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:04,390
Naomi!

346
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:06,267
Stay calm.
Just keep breathing, okay?

347
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,768
I'm just a couple seconds away.

348
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:09,186
I'm right behind you.

349
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,480
Okay, reach out your hand to me.

350
00:21:11,564 --> 00:21:14,024
Reach as far as you can.

351
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:15,401
I'm trying. I'm trying.

352
00:21:16,986 --> 00:21:19,106
- Stay with me, Lucia.
- I can't... I can't...

353
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,050
- Reach out!
- I can't see you!

354
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:22,074
I can't see you. Please.

355
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:23,158
Please. Where are you?

356
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:25,411
<i>Fashaam!</i>

357
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:28,122
I got you!

358
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:30,124
Hold on to me!

359
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:34,023
It's okay.

360
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:35,629
I'm here. I'm here.

361
00:21:35,713 --> 00:21:37,590
I'm here. You're okay.

362
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:41,112
It's okay.

363
00:21:43,012 --> 00:21:45,306
I've got you now.
I've got you.

364
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:52,396
It's okay now. We're okay.

365
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:54,523
Thank you.

366
00:21:54,607 --> 00:21:55,733
Thank you.

367
00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:17,630
Clear.

368
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:19,632
Clear.

369
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,260
- Where'd Holden go from here?
- We need a fix.

370
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:27,139
Can't reach the ship.

371
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:30,559
Wait.

372
00:22:30,643 --> 00:22:32,436
- What is it?
- I've got a message from Amos.

373
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,772
<i>Wei, I'm coming for your boss.</i>

374
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:36,398
<i>Don't be there when I do.</i>

375
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:39,610
Your boyfriend
has an economical way with words.

376
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:42,613
I'd rather not go
into unknown territory

377
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:43,989
with an armed killer at my back.

378
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:46,909
Which means we take him here.

379
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:52,414
If it has to be done, I do it.

380
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,208
That's the deal.

381
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:57,461
You have my word.

382
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:01,590
Now comes the hard part.

383
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:04,301
- Which is?
- Actually finding this bomb.

384
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:07,179
I thought you knew
where this dead spot was.

385
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:09,431
I know
where the corpse is buried.

386
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:11,183
We might just have to do
a little digging

387
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,893
to find the bullet inside, you know?

388
00:23:12,977 --> 00:23:13,978
Through here.

389
00:23:19,108 --> 00:23:20,275
You all right?

390
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:39,253
Across that, I take it?

391
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:40,629
Oh, yeah.

392
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:57,730
If I slip off, how long will I fall?

393
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:00,983
Mm...

394
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,151
Rest of your life.

395
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:13,704
Watch your step.

396
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:31,472
Bitch, I see one more
goddamn thing come out of your ship,

397
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:32,639
I will blow you into scrap.

398
00:24:32,723 --> 00:24:34,850
Assholes. How bad are we hit?

399
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:36,226
It ain't good.

400
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,603
We lost 11 thrusters.

401
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:39,313
I burned a ton of power
firing the PDCs

402
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:41,648
and a bunch of reaction mass
trying to control this spin.

403
00:24:41,732 --> 00:24:44,193
The batteries are low,
but I don't see any extra draw.

404
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:45,694
No shorts draining power.

405
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:47,446
Can you kill the rest of this spin?

406
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,198
I'll have to keep
rolling the ship,

407
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:50,991
but this damn tether's
making it tricky.

408
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:52,326
- Oh!
- What was that?

409
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:54,578
The Barb must be catching
some more drag.

410
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:55,871
That tether's pulling us back.

411
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:57,414
Much more of this and it will snap.

412
00:24:57,498 --> 00:25:00,209
I really need to do another burn,
or this is gonna get worse fast.

413
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:01,877
How many of the aft thrusters
are gone?

414
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,670
Everything on that side is dead.

415
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:05,089
So, if I burn, we start to spin,

416
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:07,091
and I gotta roll the ship
in order to stop it.

417
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:08,217
There has to be a way.

418
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,302
Bloody RCE sons of bitches.

419
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:12,888
If they have anything else
to throw at us, we're sitting ducks.

420
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,515
You were bluffing about your weapons?

421
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:16,725
We don't have enough juice to spare
to fire the PDCs.

422
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:18,727
We have to let it go.

423
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:22,523
The crew from the Barbapiccola
can transit over to us.

424
00:25:23,816 --> 00:25:25,067
- Cut the tether.
- No...

425
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,152
Let the ship go.

426
00:25:27,236 --> 00:25:28,237
Lucia.

427
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,239
No one else dies for this dream.

428
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,246
We tried everything.

429
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:42,084
No.

430
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,045
No, we did not.

431
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:51,635
Alex.

432
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,513
Railgun's got
its own batteries.

433
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:56,473
It's not gonna drain main power
if we fire it.

434
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:57,933
It isn't about power.

435
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,269
- It's about snapping that tether.
- I don't understand.

436
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:01,645
Without the drive to compensate,

437
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:04,148
the kick from the railgun
turns it into a big ol' thruster.

438
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:06,567
And it won't throw us into a spin
in the wrong direction.

439
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,652
It isn't a gentle push.

440
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,279
It'll feel like falling off a cliff.

441
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:12,197
I don't know if the cable can take it.

442
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:15,659
If it don't work, we'll evacuate
the Barb like Lucia said.

443
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:18,162
But at this point,
we got nothing to lose.

444
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:23,167
Okay.

445
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:26,587
I'm gonna go below and see if I can
fix any of those bad thrusters.

446
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,839
- Warn me before you fire.
- You got it.

447
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:30,674
Tell Felcia what we're doing.

448
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:37,389
All I know for sure

449
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:40,058
is that this room
is the center of the dead spot.

450
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:43,353
So, just look around for anything
that seems out of place.

451
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:45,230
I think I got it.

452
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:48,066
Don't keep it to yourself.
What's it look like?

453
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,027
The eye of an angry god.

454
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:57,451
I need to put myself
into something physical.

455
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,411
You can do that?

456
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:01,788
How do you think I've been
turning all this shit on?

457
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:03,290
Well, once I'm inside,

458
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:07,252
I'm gonna flip every last switch on
in the network, okay?

459
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:08,921
I'm gonna connect myself
to everything.

460
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:10,672
I'm gonna wake up
the whole damn planet.

461
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:12,007
- So, be ready.
- And then what?

462
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,300
You walk into that?

463
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:15,135
Boom.

464
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:19,640
You came here to die.

465
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,726
If you can call this livin', pal.

466
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:26,230
But, hey, I'm gonna take the rest
of this place with me, too.

467
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:28,565
And...

468
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:32,986
maybe 100,000 screaming souls
finally get some rest.

469
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:35,739
So, yeah, I...

470
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,532
Ah! Damn it!

471
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:39,326
We need to talk about that ride, kid.

472
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:41,828
Next clue in the case.

473
00:27:41,912 --> 00:27:43,705
Ah! Fuck!

474
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:51,046
Man.

475
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:52,756
They really don't want me doing this.

476
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:55,342
I don't have a lot of time.

477
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:57,386
Okay.

478
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:02,432
That.

479
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:06,561
That's mostly intact, and it's mobile.

480
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:08,563
All right, when I take control of it,

481
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:11,066
I need you to guide me as close

482
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:13,485
to this angry god's eye thing
as you can get

483
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:15,070
without me touching it, okay?

484
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:18,782
If I go inside without taking
everything else with me, we lose.

485
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:21,410
How will I know when you've connected
to the rest of the planet?

486
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:22,953
You'll know.

487
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:24,830
And that'll fix the ships?

488
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:26,248
Here's hoping.

489
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:29,001
This is really the end, isn't it?

490
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:31,003
It is for me.

491
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:34,548
But, hey, I'm hoping
you make it out okay.

492
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:40,429
Oh, uh, there's a glob of blue shit
under the decking of the cargo bay.

493
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:44,016
Uh, you might wanna
clean that up, after.

494
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:45,851
Fuck. Of course.

495
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:46,935
Yeah.

496
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:49,146
This thing...

497
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:51,440
killed the Builders,

498
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:53,233
and now we're using their Ring Gates.

499
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:54,818
Yeah.

500
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:57,779
Yeah, that could be a problem.

501
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:00,699
You might wanna look into that.

502
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:04,244
That's it?

503
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:06,163
No explanation?

504
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:09,499
No cop stories or tortured metaphors?

505
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:11,460
Hey, I got you this far, kid.

506
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:13,712
Rest is up to you.

507
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:19,760
Water.

508
00:29:22,888 --> 00:29:24,556
Rain is just water.

509
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:28,852
Doesn't really taste like anything.

510
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:54,669
Hey.

511
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:55,796
Amos.

512
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,631
Where's Holden?

513
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:58,924
Murtry's dealing with him.

514
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:02,928
Cut the tough-guy shit.
We both know what we are.

515
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:05,931
We're survivors.
We roll with the punches.

516
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:09,101
No one does what we do
and keeps their hands clean.

517
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:10,852
We kill people for money.

518
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:13,563
And it's always someone else
getting rich from our work,

519
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:15,524
but this time, it can be us.

520
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:17,901
Don't do this.

521
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:23,907
Just fucking talk to me.
I don't wanna hurt you.

522
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:33,166
And we both know
that you don't wanna hurt me.

523
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:40,799
One fucked-up day of shitty choices
for us both, but afterward,

524
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:42,926
we can walk away
from this life forever.

525
00:30:44,136 --> 00:30:46,096
Is that the story
that Murtry sold you?

526
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,433
That's how it is.

527
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:54,729
I told you that I would
never lie to you.

528
00:30:57,941 --> 00:30:59,359
I remember.

529
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:02,028
I'm going after Holden.

530
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:05,657
And if you're in my way,

531
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:07,451
I'm going through you.

532
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:13,206
I can't let you do that.

533
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:30,474
Go!

534
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:42,694
Holden!

535
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:54,539
Holden?

536
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:57,250
Holden!

537
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:06,760
<i>Everyone is braced.
We're ready.</i>

538
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:18,396
Oof.

539
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,905
That gave us a little boost.

540
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,573
Not enough to stabilize us for long,

541
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:31,993
but I can get a few more shots off
before the power runs out.

542
00:32:32,077 --> 00:32:33,537
<i>I've got two thrusters back.</i>

543
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,206
<i>It might buy enough time
for me to make this work.</i>

544
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:38,083
<i>- Keep it up.</i>
- If it doesn't work...

545
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:41,670
If we gotta get your people
off that ship, we will.

546
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:50,720
Miller!

547
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:54,057
Are you there?

548
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:02,649
Can you hear me?

549
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:06,027
Holden!

550
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,180
Holden!

551
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:09,573
Doc?

552
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:11,283
Holden! Holden!

553
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:12,826
What are you doing here?

554
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:13,910
Are you hurt?

555
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:15,495
No, but Murtry's coming to kill you.

556
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:17,289
He shot Amos.

557
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:19,374
Is he dead?

558
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:20,458
I don't know.

559
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:23,128
Wei is dead. Amos killed her.

560
00:33:24,462 --> 00:33:25,505
Miller!

561
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:28,425
What is that?

562
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:30,302
Do not touch that.

563
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:32,304
Just wait here.
I'll be right back.

564
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,988
Whoa. Fuck.

565
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:53,158
Who the fuck... are you?

566
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:55,035
Who the fuck are you?

567
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:56,411
Hey!

568
00:33:56,494 --> 00:33:57,954
Who the fuck are you?

569
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:00,999
Hello?

570
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:03,335
Uh, I'm Elvi...

571
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,961
Okoye.

572
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,589
Who...

573
00:34:07,672 --> 00:34:08,882
What are you?

574
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:09,966
Fucked, lady.

575
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,968
What I am is fucked.
Where the hell's Holden?

576
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:15,597
I think he went to find Amos.

577
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,016
Well,
his timing fuckin' sucks.

578
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:21,353
Wait. You are Holden's ghost.

579
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:23,772
Miller?

580
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:26,149
Yeah.
Yeah, I've looked better.

581
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:28,193
How are you able to talk to me?

582
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:30,278
It's complicated.
Now, listen.

583
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:32,238
You see something funny
in this room somewhere?

584
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:33,531
Somethin' unusual?

585
00:34:34,407 --> 00:34:35,950
Yes, that field effect.

586
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:37,994
I can see it. What is it?

587
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:42,248
With any luck, the off switch
for the whole fucking planet.

588
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:48,046
How'd that happen?

589
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:53,134
Well, then.

590
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:55,887
That was a little trickier
than I thought.

591
00:34:56,554 --> 00:34:57,806
Okay, then.

592
00:34:58,723 --> 00:34:59,724
Okay.

593
00:35:00,308 --> 00:35:01,309
Lady.

594
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:03,061
You're gonna help me.

595
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:15,031
Where's Amos?

596
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:17,075
Is he alive?

597
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:18,243
I don't know.

598
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:21,246
He was too hurt to walk,
and he had a shotgun.

599
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:23,957
Going around him
seemed the wiser choice.

600
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:26,292
If he's dead, so are you.

601
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:29,671
Wei tried to appeal to his humanity,

602
00:35:31,047 --> 00:35:32,340
but he killed her for it.

603
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:34,259
You should start appealing to mine.

604
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,595
You broken my planet yet?

605
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:40,432
Working on it.

606
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:55,071
You are really Detective Miller
from Ceres,

607
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:57,323
sentient and independent?

608
00:35:57,407 --> 00:35:59,993
Well, if I'm not,
I'm acing my Turing test.

609
00:36:00,076 --> 00:36:02,245
About how far am I from this thing?

610
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:03,705
A few meters, roughly.

611
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:06,249
Move me a little closer.

612
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:08,334
I don't know how fast
these locals are gonna react

613
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:09,919
when they figure out what I'm doing.

614
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:11,045
The locals?

615
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:12,672
Let's just hope you don't meet.

616
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:15,717
You're about a meter away.
Is this good?

617
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,093
Okay. Yeah.

618
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:27,937
People like you always forget.

619
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:30,690
Civilization has a lag time,

620
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:33,193
like light delay.

621
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:34,319
You come out here,

622
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:36,613
and you think
because you're civilized,

623
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:38,782
civilization comes with you.

624
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:41,409
Throw your gun down.
Put your hands on your head.

625
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,078
You'll only get this one chance.

626
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:49,918
We're all just walking
in the footsteps of history,

627
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:53,004
the ancient frontier.

628
00:36:53,963 --> 00:36:57,592
All those post offices
and railroads and jails

629
00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:01,137
cost thousands of lives to build.

630
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:03,348
And this is no different.

631
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,520
I am the kind of man
the frontier needs.

632
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:13,149
You're the kind that comes
after my work is done.

633
00:37:14,943 --> 00:37:16,528
You should've stayed at home

634
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:19,948
until I built a post office.

635
00:37:20,615 --> 00:37:22,116
I met another guy once

636
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:26,371
who liked using past genocides
to justify his bullshit.

637
00:37:27,455 --> 00:37:28,957
You weren't persuaded?

638
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,793
A friend of mine shot him in the face.

639
00:38:15,336 --> 00:38:19,507
You won't even have the balls
to finish me, will you, boy?

640
00:38:20,091 --> 00:38:21,676
You are finished.

641
00:38:23,261 --> 00:38:25,305
I'm gonna bring you back
to stand trial,

642
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:28,141
then drop you in a cell forever.

643
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:31,352
We call that "civilization."

644
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:42,906
All right, aim me.

645
00:38:43,698 --> 00:38:45,408
Come on. Point me at this thing.

646
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:50,747
Just, uh, go straight ahead.

647
00:38:59,714 --> 00:39:00,715
No!

648
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:03,092
Get off!

649
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:48,680
Man, that could've gone better.

650
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:50,515
Well, I'll guide you back.

651
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:53,476
Nah. I'm fucked. I can't move.

652
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:39,731
Got it. That's it.

653
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:41,941
Good. Good.

654
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:45,737
Uh, let's go. Let's go.

655
00:40:50,825 --> 00:40:51,868
Wait!
