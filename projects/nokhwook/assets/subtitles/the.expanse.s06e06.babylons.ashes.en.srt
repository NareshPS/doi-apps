00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:08,217


3
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:10,302

My new coordination protocol

4
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:12,763
returned a coherent
reply pattern.

5
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:15,641
I feel weird.
What happened?

6
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:19,353
You got hurt,
like, killed hurt.

7
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:23,357
I'm going to stay here
with Joseph on Ceres.

8
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,109
 Anytime anyone
goes through a Ring,

9
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,403
they don't realize
they're taking a massive risk.

10
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:32,283
 

11
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:33,617
 Inaros can rain hell

12
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,453
on any point
inside the Ring Space.

13
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:36,662

We need to load up

14
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,205
every warship
we've got right now.

15
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,624
Do you truly believe
the odds are in our favor?

16
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,460
 They have size,
we have numbers.

17
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,669
No matter what they do now,

18
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,463
they can't engage us
everywhere at once.

19
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:47,214

We need Drummer's strength.

20
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,008
It's really that bad?

21
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,551
We have lost more ships
than we could afford.

22
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,094
I despise Marco.

23
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,971
Avasarala and her Inners
are no better.

24
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,347
That was true once.

25
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,892
The system is filled
with the graves of Belters

26
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,435
who trusted Inners.

27
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:01,312
My people will not
take orders from you.

28
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:03,522
I don't expect them to.

29
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:07,026
 

30
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:20,039
 

31
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:23,793


32
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:34,637


33
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:39,183
-  Cara, baby.
- Ow!

34
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:40,976
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

35
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,937
You can't do that,
just run off.

36
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:44,230
- I'm okay.
-  You scared the hell

37
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,731
- out of us.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to.

38
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,107
 What did you do with Xan?
 Why would you do that?

39
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,275
You have to tell us
where he is, baby.

40
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,443
It's not right
to leave him out there.

41
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,861
I'm sorry!

42
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:54,031
I didn't know how long
it was gonna take to fix him.

43
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,950
Fix him?

44
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:58,911
The dogs fixed him.

45
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,913
Dogs? What are
you talking about?

46
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:03,415
Where is your brother?

47
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,376


48
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:08,379


49
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:13,259
 

50
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:15,010
I want a hug, too.

51
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,763
- It's okay, he's fine.
- No.

52
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,390
Stay behind me!

53
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,308
Get out, whatever the hell
you are, get out of here!

54
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,185
Stop it,
It's Xan, stop!

55
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:24,895
 No, baby, it's not Xan.
It can't be.

56
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,814
You brother's gone.
He's gone.

57
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,023
-  No!
- Daddy?

58
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,109
- Ahh!
-  Stop, no!

59
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:37,116
 

60
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,329
 No!

61
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,206
 Daddy...

62
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:47,334


63
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,714
I'm calling the soldiers.

64
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:54,091
 

65
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,844
Cara?
Cara!

66
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,637
Cara where are you?

67
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:03,434
Cara, Cara, Cara!

68
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:05,436
Cara, Cara!

69
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:07,271
 Mommy, Daddy!
 Cara!

70
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,522
 Over here!
Mommy, Daddy!

71
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,899
 Just keep talking!
We're almost there!

72
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:11,775
 Baby, we're coming!
 We're gonna find you!

73
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,737
- 
- 

74
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,116
-  They're scared of me.
- I know, I'm sorry.

75
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,535
Xan, the soldiers are coming.
We have to go, we have to go!

76
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,162
Come on.

77
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:26,248

Mommy, Daddy, I'm over here!

78
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,958
Mommy, Daddy!

79
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,961


80
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:37,968
 

81
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:42,222
There's nothing
you can eat out here.

82
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,683
You'll die.

83
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:48,228
- 
- 

84
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,610
It's okay.
If I die, the dogs will fix me.

85
00:03:54,610 --> 00:04:01,617
 

86
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,218
 Free Navy is using
standard evasion tactics

87
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:22,596
to try to disguise their
numbers and drive signatures.

88
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,015
But it's clear
that they are forming up

89
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,977
into three major battle groups
en route to the Ring.

90
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:30,521
They know we're gonna engage
with them at some point.

91
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,773
So they're trying
to split up our forces,

92
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,401
reduce our torpedo advantage
head-to-head.

93
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:37,778
 Marco Inaros
doesn't want to slug it out.

94
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,738
He just needs to get past us.

95
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,449
Given the engagement
of the UNN, MCRN,

96
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,118
and friendly Belter assets,

97
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,412
the best opportunity
to stop them will be here,

98
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:49,039
here and here...

99
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,041
all of our combined forces

100
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,751
against virtually
all of theirs.

101
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,130
Massing battleships
is a numbers game

102
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,465
since the Age of Sail.

103
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:03,429
These numbers are too evenly
matched for my comfort.

104
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:06,015
Hard to believe the Inner fleets
have been reduced to this.

105
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:08,350
I'm sure you and your faction
did their part.

106
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,437
Not recently,
but things can change quickly.

107
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:12,855
It's this kind of bullshit

108
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:16,191
that has left all of us
with fewer ships.

109
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,027
 The strength
of the Free Navy warships

110
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:21,196
is concentrated
in these two groups.

111
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:24,074
UNN and MCRN fleets
will take on those.

112
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,369
This group consists primarily
of tenders and supply vessels

113
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,079
with a smaller gunship escort.

114
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,706
Your ships should be able
to handle them.

115
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,041
 Don't worry about us.

116
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,417
We will do
what needs to be done.

117
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,127
I like it.

118
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,838
Enough with all the hit and run
guerilla war crap.

119
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,090
This time Inaros is gonna
have to stand and fight,

120
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,760
and we're gonna put an end
to it once and for all.

121
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,219
And if we don't,

122
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,889
the Free Navy will cruise
through the Ring.

123
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,433
Marco will hunker down
on Medina station

124
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,310
behind his railguns

125
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,105
in control of our colonies
and a thousand systems,

126
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:58,901
dictating the fate of
our species for a generation.

127
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:01,612
Which is why we have a plan B.

128
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,864
While the combined fleet
moves into position

129
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,491
to engage the Free Navy,

130
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:08,869
the Roci will be
on a hard burn to get here.

131
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,746
 We will rendezvous
with an old ice hauler,

132
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:13,165
the Giambattista,
which will be transporting

133
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,541
a heavily armed assault team.

134
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,253
- To assault what?
- The Ring Station.

135
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,214
We're gonna capture
Marco's railguns.

136
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:24,093
Those guns have shredded
half a dozen MCRN gunships

137
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:25,469
in a matter of seconds.

138
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,346
The strike team
was taken by surprise.

139
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,473
They didn't know that
the railguns were there.

140
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:31,433
We've come up with a way
to distract those guns

141
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,685
and make ourselves
a much harder target.

142
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:34,895
We'll get to that
in a minute.

143
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,522
It's quite ingenious
actually.

144
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,315
Would make a Belter proud.

145
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,067
Thank you.

146
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,819
The MCRN strike team
destroyed the Free Navy ships

147
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,070
guarding the Ring,

148
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,197
so there'll be no resistance
on our way in.

149
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,533
While the Rocinante takes out
Medina Station's

150
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:50,661
targeting and comm arrays,
the assault team will land

151
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,162
on the surface
of the Ring Station

152
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,456
under the minimum firing limit
of the railguns.

153
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,959
We'll take the control bunker,
turn the guns on Medina,

154
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,502
and force them to surrender.

155
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:01,004
And if any Free Navy ships
get past the main fleet action

156
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,798
and come through the Ring
behind us,

157
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:06,802
we'll use their own guns
to blow them straight to hell.

158
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,804
Is this the best
you could come up with?

159
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,430
Madam,
I know the Ring Space

160
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,641
and that station better
than anyone.

161
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,560
We'll get it done.

162
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,521
You're such
a fucking optimist.

163
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:21,233
It's a miracle
you have lived this long.

164
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,444
 

165
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,240


166
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:35,247
 

167
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:45,174


168
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:52,181
 

169
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:13,827
 

170
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,149


171
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,449
 Reporting for duty
as ordered.

172
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,284
Take your station.

173
00:08:56,328 --> 00:09:01,166
On Medina, they say Drummer
always kiss the Inners' boot.

174
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,918

Welwalla finally gonya get

175
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:05,003
what she deserve then, keya?

176
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,964
 We will rewrite
the history book.

177
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,466


178
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,806
- Something wrong?
- Why would it be?

179
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:17,766
I convinced your father
to reinstate you

180
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,894
because I believe he's better
with you at his side.

181
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,981
Even though he'd never admit it,
he needs you.

182
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:27,776
And we all need to be able
to count on you.

183
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,237
- Can we?
- Of course.

184
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,155
 Monitor the situation,
but no open comms.

185
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,700

Aye, Captain.

186
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,163
Good.

187
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,754
 I told you they would
split their forces.

188
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,965
You still don't like the odds.

189
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,508
Not my kind of fight.

190
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:55,971
This battle was inevitable
sooner or later.

191
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:58,890
I'd have preferred later
after a clean run to Medina

192
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,310
and us safely behind
those big Laconian guns.

193
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,313
And who knows what else?

194
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:09,818
You're expecting something
more from Duarte?

195
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,321
 Well, you know how much
I like surprises.

196
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:15,324


197
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:22,331
 

198
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,471


199
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,769
- Full load.
- Thanks.

200
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,902
That thing can really
hold all this?

201
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:53,862
Hell yeah.

202
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,831
- Problem?
- No.

203
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,501
You know, a lot
of Martians still consider

204
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,045
the Rocinante a stolen ship.

205
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,130
They insist
on calling it the Tachi.

206
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,424
Must have driven Alex crazy.

207
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,634
It did.

208
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,928
He'd tell people
that the ship wasn't stolen.

209
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,471
It was just smart.

210
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,723
And went looking for people
worthy enough to fly it.

211
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,434


212
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,063
When we're done
with this business,

213
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,981
I'm gonna tell
that story a lot.

214
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,029


215
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,282
 Sorry.

216
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,994
 Why don't you
go get some rest?

217
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,746
We're all gonna need it.

218
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:48,208
As soon as we're ship-shape
and secure, I will.

219
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,293
I promise.

220
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,635
 I'm gonna go restock
the fast-patch kits.

221
00:11:58,635 --> 00:11:59,845
Clarissa.

222
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,182
Can you do me a favor?

223
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,642
Sure.

224
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,060
The juice injectors in ops

225
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,770
haven't been flushed
and reset for a while.

226
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,106
I know a visual check's
standard, but considering...

227
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,483
I can take care of that.

228
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,319
- Okay to do it now?
- Yeah, patch kits can wait.

229
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,238
Thanks, boss.

230
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:23,994
 The injectors
are my responsibility.

231
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:26,288
You know that.

232
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,248
Do you remember the first
time you called me boss?

233
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,709
- No.
- It was halfway through

234
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,961
my first run on the Cant.
You'd been there longer.

235
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,005
I thought you were
fucking with me,

236
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,548
- putting me in my place.
- You were the engineer.

237
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:37,549
I was a mechanic.

238
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:40,218
- You were the boss.
- Yeah.

239
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,724
After a while...

240
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,059
it meant more than that.

241
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,271
That's true.

242
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,983
Clarissa calls you boss now.

243
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,903
I think she means it
in the same way.

244
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,539


245
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:18,131


246
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,305


247
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:31,645


248
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,933
 What's all this?

249
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:15,021
It's been a while since any
of us had a home cooked meal.

250
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,149
I thought I'd give it a try.

251
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,859
I'll set the table.

252
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,779
 What smells so good?
 What do we have here?

253
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,614
Textured mushroom
seco de carne

254
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:28,243
with soy tequeos on the side,
our chef's specialty...

255
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:31,246
Can I get... all right.

256
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,582
Of course,
he had the real stuff.

257
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:34,958
Don't get your hopes up.

258
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,085
I can always whip up
some red kibble in a pinch.

259
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,546
Oh God, please don't.

260
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,756
I'm hungry,
I'm not that hungry.

261
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,760
- Yum.
- Not ready yet.

262
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,095

You need a hand, Clarissa?

263
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,597
 You're gonna grab
with your hand? Get a spoon.

264
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,056
 Hang on.

265
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,686
 She's trying to wash
the blood off her hands.

266
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:55,979
 Can I try it now?

267
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,356
That's what I wanted
for Filip.

268
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,568
Ooh, it's hot.

269
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,903
And I didn't wanna
give her a chance.

270
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,905
I'm glad you did.

271
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,908


272
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,579
 

273
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,831
I'm going down
to the Ring Station

274
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:18,084
with the ground assault.

275
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,753
You can't.

276
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:23,632
The ship can't go into battle
without a mechanic.

277
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:25,508
Ship's got one.

278
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,182
Look, it's gonna be
a shitstorm down there,

279
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,768
and if I'm gonna get myself
offed for the cause, fine.

280
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,311
Better reason than most.

281
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,937
I just prefer
to be looking the guy

282
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,316
who's gonna punch my ticket
straight in the fucking eye.

283
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,735


284
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,614
You know,
for someone who says

285
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,492
they don't wanna be a hero...

286
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,373
You sure end up
being one a lot.

287
00:15:56,373 --> 00:16:01,086
 

288
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,338
Tequeos?

289
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,423
-  This is good.
- Thank you.

290
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:08,510
 Not too much salt?
 Mm-mm.

291
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,972

He can get his own pot.

292
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,058
 Ha.

293
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:22,065
 

294
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:43,545


295
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,385
 Madam Secretary
General, CIC.

296
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:53,638
The drive sigs the Rocinante
got for us paid off.

297
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,015
We've located the Pella.

298
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,396
I'm on my way.

299
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:08,403
 

300
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,412


301
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,791

Combined fleet flash.

302
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,210
UNN battle group one
has located the Pella

303
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,337
and will engage.

304
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:33,344
 

305
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:38,767


306
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,787


307
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:01,623
Oye, Bosmang,
Inyalowda just report

308
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:04,000
they ID the Pella in
main Free Navy battle group.

309
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,586
-  I heard.
- If they kill Marco without us

310
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,797
you think maybe they
try to cut us out later?

311
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,381
That remains to be seen.

312
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,551
They have their targets.
We have ours.

313
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:16,095
The frigate is the main threat.

314
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,848
If we kill it first, we can
make the rest surrender or run.

315
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,683

Oh, we not the freighter run.

316
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,143
A fat prize.

317
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,979
If we cannot kill
Marco ourselves,

318
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,357
happy to take what is his.

319
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:32,779


320
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,240

Torpedoes are away.

321
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:58,429
 You look nervous.

322
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,224
I am nervous, ma'am,
for you.

323
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:02,725
We're in a forward position.

324
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,477
I'd feel much better
if our secretary general

325
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,854
were safely in the rear guard.

326
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,856
- I'm sure that...
- I need to be close enough

327
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:11,359
to maintain real-time
communication with the fleet.

328
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,196
If certain orders need to be
given, I will give them myself.

329
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,586
 I wish we had
more assets on our flank.

330
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:30,879
It was disappointing
that more Belters

331
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,338
didn't rally to the cause,

332
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,382
especially after all you did
for them on Ceres.

333
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:38,636
What we did was too little
and too late,

334
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:42,724
the sad story of our species.

335
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:45,143
 I want to
capture the freighter intact.

336
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,395
Concentrate all fire
on the frigate.

337
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,731
All ships acknowledge.

338
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,444
Fire!

339
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:57,363


340
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:04,078
 

341
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,752
Captain,
freighter is breaking up.

342
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:13,421
Pashang.
All ships, this is Drummer.

343
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,090
Whoever is targeting
the freighter, disengage.

344
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,217
Concentrate all fire
on the frigate.

345
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,852

Direct hit on Pella.

346
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,900
 The Pella's hurt.
They're falling back.

347
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,944
Must have damaged
their reactor.

348
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,746
The other ships aren't
falling back to protect it.

349
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,920
It's not even returning fire.

350
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:59,676
I don't think Marco Inaros
is on that ship.

351
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,014

Captain, all ships report,

352
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,933
no one is fighting
at the freighter.

353
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,267

Copy, all missile systems.

354
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,436
Target is locked.

355
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,566
Checking,
one, two, three, checking.

356
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,819

All targeting systems green.

357
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:19,737

Stand by for firing.

358
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,739
- It isn't a freighter.
-  Standing by.

359
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:28,746
 

360
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,713
 Hull plates away.

361
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,758
Fire!

362
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,727
All ships,
counter batteries, fire!

363
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,818
 Cut thrust.
Broadside to incoming!

364
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,945
All guns free-fire!

365
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,954

Captain, we've got the...

366
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,714

Drusilla here, still alive.

367
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:22,300
But our missile ran dry.

368
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:24,802

Khandahar here also.

369
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,889
Torpedo down.
All we can do is fly.

370
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:30,183


371
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:33,478


372
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,399
Report.

373
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,777

Drive intact, reactor failing.

374
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:44,363
Going into shutdown.
All torpedo gone.

375
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,115
- The others?
- Four ships lost.

376
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,450
No power to five.

377
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,951
Khandahar and Drusilla
are operational

378
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,870
but also no torpedoes.

379
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,538
Pella is underway again.

380
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,791
Resuming original course
for the Ring.

381
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,251
All ships, this is Drummer.

382
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,545
Disengage, collect survivors,

383
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,673
and rejoin the fleet
if you can.

384
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,967
Leave the Pella to me.

385
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:09,889

A collision course? Captain...

386
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,432
We can still catch it.

387
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:12,850
Reactor will overload.

388
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,977
That will help.

389
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,607


390
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:25,696
Oye, bosmang.

391
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,491
Think we think the same.

392
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:31,911
Just beat you to it.

393
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,413
Tenye wa chesh gut.

394
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:41,337
 

395
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,688


396
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,982
Damage amidships.
Hull breach on deck four.

397
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,567

Got a problem in reactor!

398
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:03,860
We're losing drive three!

399
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,571
Balance thrusters!
Kill drives three and one!

400
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:08,906
On it, I'll shut down
drive three and drive...

401
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,575


402
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:13,995
- 
- 

403
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:17,081


404
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,333


405
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,878
She needs a medic
and a patch kit.

406
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:24,130
Is it bad?
Am I hit?

407
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:30,219
I don't wanna go.

408
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,805
She needs help!

409
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:39,812
 

410
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,778

All combined fleet elements,

411
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:50,573
UNN SIGINT reports the Pella
may be flying disguised.

412
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,909
Be on the lookout
for atypical hull profiles

413
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,745
and unusual drive signatures
and approach with caution.

414
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:57,121
Ship status.

415
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:59,248

Reactor on low but stable.

416
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:02,001
- We can still limp.
-  Tightbeam Fleet.

417
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:05,796
Apprise them of our situation
and set a rendezvous.

418
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,299
We've done all we can.

419
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,803
Tenye wa chesh gut, Rocinante.

420
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,528

Cooper, ready.

421
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:33,407

Gates, ready.

422
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:34,867

Rogan, ready.

423
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,827

Stone, ready.

424
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,957

Hudson, ready.

425
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:42,166

Burton, ready.

426
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,501
How you feeling, brother?

427
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:45,753
Like I'm trapped
in a portable toilet.

428
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:48,506
Try not to dwell on that.
You'll pee in your suit.

429
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:50,466
No one dies
with a full bladder.

430
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,677
I'll be adjusting your
evasive patterns on the fly

431
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:54,595
depending on
what those railguns do.

432
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:55,846
Same for the Roci.

433
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,431
Gonna be a bumpy ride
for all us.

434
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,767
Giambattista remote
nav link is solid.

435
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:00,977

Drake, ready.

436
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:03,104
 Ring comm relay
ready for deploy.

437
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:05,147

Ripley, ready.

438
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,941

Star, ready.

439
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:09,360
Assault team
is three zero green.

440
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,778
Roci, we're ready to roll.

441
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:13,572
Copy that.
All pods, stand by for launch.

442
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:17,493
Good luck.

443
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,537
You never say that
before a fight.

444
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,539
- You say good hunting.
- Good hunting.

445
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:28,212
Same to you all.
Rocinante out.

446
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:04,665
Naomi's last sim said

447
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:07,543
that the railguns should
only get about 20% of us.

448
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:10,546
Those odds aren't terrible.

449
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,340
A little worse
than Russian Roulette.

450
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,301
What's that, a casino game?

451
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,136
Kinda.

452
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:55,424
The railguns are shifting
target to the pods.

453
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:56,509
And us.

454
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,891
I'll fly as close
to the periphery as I can.

455
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:05,976
Make us as hard to target
as possible

456
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:08,354
till I can put Medina between
us and those fucking guns.

457
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,022
We're losing too many pods.

458
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,149
Those railguns are
firing so goddamn fast.

459
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:14,944
Assault team, stand by!
Setting evasion pattern to max.

460
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:17,154
Everyone, pucker up.
It's about to get rough.

461
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:23,661
Fuck.

462
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:25,246


463
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:28,624
It's working.
The hit rate's going down.

464
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,376
 They're burning
reaction mass like crazy.

465
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:31,961
The landing's gonna be brutal.

466
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:34,463
At least we're giving them
a chance to land.

467
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:37,675


468
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,971

Damage report!

469
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:44,223


470
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,726
Goddamn, the new armor held.

471
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,355
What the fuck?
We're losing power.

472
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,317
 I'm seeing
multiple faults in the grid!

473
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,694
The reactor's trying to scram.

474
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,154
Override, we can't slow down.

475
00:28:58,154 --> 00:28:59,613
If we don't,
we'll melt the core.

476
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,157
If we slow down, we're dead.

477
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:03,451


478
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:05,327
I'll fix it.

479
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:26,307
 We're stable
but still losing power.

480
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:30,019
 

481
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:31,103
Ohh...

482
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,318


483
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,365


484
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:02,968
A coolant pipe dislodged.
I have to reseat and patch it.

485
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,345
There's tools
in the machine shop.

486
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:06,347
There's no time for that.
We need more thrust now.

487
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:08,224


488
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,277
I know what to do.

489
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:22,821


490
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,867
Clarissa.

491
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:27,952
Clarissa!

492
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:34,959
 

493
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:37,795
Come on.

494
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:39,713
Come on!

495
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,860
Incoming fast movers
from Medina, spreading fast.

496
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,654
They're going for the pods.

497
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:05,823
Ready torpedoes
for counter battery.

498
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:07,199
Ready PDCs.

499
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,130
- Fuck.
- How many left?

500
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,007
Enough to get the job done.

501
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:25,217
Everybody ready to get
a little shorter?

502
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:28,012
This one's gonna be 15 Gs.

503
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:35,060
Ah, fuck.

504
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,063


505
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:43,360
 

506
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,571
We're out of the railguns'
line of fire.

507
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,615
Our turn, motherfuckers.

508
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:55,581
Targeting and comm arrays
on Medina are out!

509
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,124
Assault team,
you are clear to land!

510
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:59,918
Clarissa's
not answering her comm.

511
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,296
I'm going to the reactor.

512
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,683
Clarissa!

513
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,227
- I hurt my head.
- I thought you were gone.

514
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:22,232
No such luck.

515
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,109
I didn't use my mods.

516
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,990
Just a ratchet strap
and some elbow grease.

517
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,910
I'm gonna earn my keep.

518
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,912
This was a good start.

519
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,415
Aah!

520
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,211
Aah!

521
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:52,429


522
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:56,517
Aah!

523
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,813
Aah!

524
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:53,657
Move out.
You good?

525
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,076
Yeah, I'm fucking good.

526
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:58,537
All teams, sound off.
How many are left?

527
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,456

Bravo team, five total.

528
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:01,707

Charlie team, seven.

529
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,125
Copy that.
Alpha team has six.

530
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,544
Naomi's usually better
at the math than that.

531
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,087
There's the reactor.

532
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,756
Building next to it
is the control bunker.

533
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:10,424
That is our objective.

534
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,342
- Incoming!
- 

535
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:15,179
- I'm out of range.
- Get to cover!

536
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,808
Heavy weapons at the bunker,
at least two dozen contacts.

537
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:22,269
At least four RPG launchers
and heavy machine guns.

538
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:23,687
Go, go, go!

539
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:27,649
Bravo, bring your team
in first.

540
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,360
They're firing armor
piercing rounds.

541
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,821
So use the walkway as cover
as you approach.

542
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,532
 Copy that, Alpha.
But Bravo cannot comply.

543
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:38,076
We're taking heavy fire.
We can't advance.

544
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,746
Fuck, Charlie,
do you have an approach?

545
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:41,997
Charlie, report.

546
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,457

Charlie's toast!

547
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:46,251
RPGs pushed us out of cover.
Machine guns chopped us up.

548
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,170
- There's only two of us left.
- Fuck.

549
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,680
 Can Bravo give us
any help at all?

550
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,891
We've gotta get some
of this fire off our position.

551
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:04,478
Bravo, we need to push.

552
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:07,064
- Eyes up!
- 

553
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:12,986
 

554
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:14,404
Move, move, move!

555
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:18,700
 Go, go, go!

556
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,619
 Go, go, go, go, go!

557
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:24,665
 Draper, clear!

558
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:26,583

Rocinante, attack is stalled,

559
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,044
and we are pinned down taking
heavy fire from the surface

560
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,796
and from reinforcements
from Medina.

561
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:32,130
We need air support!

562
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,550
 Negative.
We have to stay behind Medina.

563
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,134
Those railguns
will be all over us

564
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,386
the second
we stick our nose out.

565
00:35:37,386 --> 00:35:38,554
What about torpedoes?

566
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:40,138
I can light them up
and guide them in.

567
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,932
 Too much danger of
impacting the surface.

568
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,559
One plasma warhead
hits too close,

569
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:44,643
and you'll all be dead, too.

570
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:45,978
Jim, I'm back.

571
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:47,729
We have to make a run
at the station.

572
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,898
The assault team's
getting cut to pieces.

573
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,777
I'll see what I can do
with countermeasures.

574
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:56,446
Try to blind the railguns'
targeting systems... give me sec.

575
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,241
- How's Clarissa?
- She made it.

576
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:00,742
We're gonna need air support.

577
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,245
They can't move until we
get of control those guns.

578
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:16,758
Fuck it. I'd rather get shot
in the front than the back.

579
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,969
Me too.

580
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:21,013
Move, move!

581
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,351
Okay, on me.
Wait for my mark.

582
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,895
Then we go full speed
for the station!

583
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:30,731
- Spread as you go to draw...
- 

584
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:34,109
Draper!
What the fuck are you doing?

585
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:40,115
All teams, fall back!

586
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:42,576
Fuck that, all teams,
covering fire!

587
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:44,828
Give them everything
we got left!

588
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:48,332


589
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:55,339
 

590
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:03,281
 Aah!

591
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:08,245
Aah!

592
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:10,497
I got you, Bobbie!

593
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:15,419
- 
- 

594
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,465
Aah!

595
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:25,846


596
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:38,025
Fuck yeah, Roci.

597
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:44,197
 No other choice.
Had to take out the guns.

598
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:50,370
I'm sorry.

599
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,832
We lost the guns.

600
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:03,759
Marco Inaros,
in regard to your request

601
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:07,387
for additional armaments,
your request is denied.

602
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:10,807
Any further communications
will be refused, and any ships

603
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:13,852
attempting to enter our space
will be destroyed.

604
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:18,148
You were a useful distraction,
but I have gods to kill.

605
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:21,568
The Ring to Laconia
is now closed.

606
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:24,029
You're on your own.

607
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:26,740
Oyedeng, Beltalowda.

608
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:35,415
Come to apologize?

609
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,667
Wise move now,
that victory is inevitable.

610
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,753
Rosenfeld is dead.

611
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,298
Too bad.

612
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,093
She would have
governed Medina well.

613
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:49,554
- She had a family.
- Yes, we were all her family.

614
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:53,975
How do you do it?

615
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,268
Do what?

616
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:58,271
So easily cope with all
the people we've killed.

617
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,232
There is nothing
to feel guilty about.

618
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:02,943
Death for some is the price
of our freedom and our future.

619
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:05,570
It could have easily been me
instead of Rosenfeld.

620
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,614
Or me.

621
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:10,075
None of us have a choice
in this.

622
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:11,952
The greatest gift
any true Belter

623
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:14,579
could wish for is to die
fighting for the cause.

624
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,791
For the cause or for you?

625
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:21,086
If it were you
and I lost you,

626
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:25,132
I would lose a piece of myself.

627
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:28,385
But I would accept my fate.

628
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:31,221
And I would be proud, because
this is the life we've chosen.

629
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:35,559
- When did I choose?
- You are my son.

630
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:37,060
After all we've done,

631
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:41,439
you still can't see

632
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,234
what you've been given.

633
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,198
I do now.

634
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,711
I want the plan to repair and
restart the railgun reactors

635
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:05,172
ready to go the moment
we recapture Medina.

636
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:07,007
Aye, Captain.

637
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:10,010


638
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:15,140
 

639
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,142
Beltalowda.

640
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:23,565
We have reached the end.

641
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:27,194
The end of the Inners'
hold upon us.

642
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:30,530
Lift your heads,

643
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,074
your eyes,

644
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:38,663
your hearts, your spirits

645
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,416
and know this.

646
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,586
 

647
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:47,672
We have been bloodied,

648
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:51,468
but they have been broken.

649
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:57,432
And when we sweep through
the Ring one last time

650
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,809
and sweep away the Rocinante

651
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:04,981
and all vestiges of the Inners
from our space,

652
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:10,111
when that moment comes,

653
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:13,490
our long struggle

654
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:17,327
will finally be over

655
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:21,456
and our victory complete.

656
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:25,085
We will rise

657
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:30,006
from the ashes
of the Inners' failures

658
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:33,802
and sow the seeds of
our humanity across the stars.

659
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:36,763
This is the end,
the end of the Inners,

660
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:41,268
and their end
will be our beginning.

661
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:47,440
Beltalowda.

662
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,655

Beltalowda, Beltalowda,

663
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:56,199
Beltalowda, Beltalowda,

664
00:42:56,199 --> 00:43:00,495
Beltalowda,
Beltalowda,

665
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:04,040
Beltalowda, Beltalowda,

666
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,585
Beltalowda,
Beltalowda,

667
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:12,966
Beltalowda, Beltalowda,
Beltalowda, Belt...

668
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:19,431
 Inaros
will arrive at the Ring

669
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:21,349
along with these ships.

670
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,685
It's all that's left
of his fleet.

671
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:26,604
But we have no assets in range
to intercept them.

672
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,691
James, I'm sorry.
Godspeed.

673
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:31,776
 I'd say
we're outnumbered.

674
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,486
 So what's the plan?

675
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:36,114
If we took the Roci down
to the Ring Station,

676
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:39,117
could we use our reactor
to power up the railguns?

677
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:41,578
If we had a couple
of weeks, maybe.

678
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:44,080
We don't have a couple weeks.

679
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,124
Then no.

680
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:50,628
A lot of places we could go
before they get here.

681
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,047
Just pick a Ring.

682
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:53,923
We don't have enough fuel
or reaction mass

683
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:55,300
to make it
to any of the colonies.

684
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,760
 Medina does.

685
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,678
We've got half a dozen
patched-up soldiers in med bay.

686
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,889
With me and him, that's
enough for an assault team.

687
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:02,974
We'd have to hold a refueling
tank for the initial travel.

688
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:05,310
Does anyone here
really wanna cut and run?

689
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:17,113


690
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:20,658
What's left of the
Giambattista is still drivable.

691
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,952
We send it back to the Ring,
set it to blow

692
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:25,080
and they come through,
that'd take out a few of them.

693
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,581
Maybe one or two more
with the debris.

694
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,583
Bloody their nose at least.

695
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,086
And then we just shoot it out
with the rest?

696
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:37,842
We have three torpedoes,
PDCs are at 60%,

697
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,804
enough railgun rounds
for a few good salvos.

698
00:44:40,804 --> 00:44:45,809
As long as we try
to kill Marco, I'm in.

699
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:48,895
We are definitely
going to do that.

700
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:54,317
Any of our passengers
wants out,

701
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:55,860
all they have to do is say so.

702
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,154
There's no shame in it.

703
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:00,407
 If we can get close,
I could try a breach-in entry.

704
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:01,658
Take a ship out that way.

705
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:03,159
 Your suit is shot
to shit,

706
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:04,828
so there's no way
you're gonna...

707
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:07,080
 The railgun is
our only real asset here.

708
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,707


709
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,502
We might be able to trigger
the Ring Entities.

710
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,589
When we came through the Ring
with the Giambattista,

711
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,550
we lost some of the pods
to transit,

712
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:21,052
which means we were
already close to the threshold.

713
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,596
If we push every bit of mass
and energy we can

714
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:26,599
through the Ring all at once,
every torpedo

715
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:30,854
and railgun slug,
and we time it all just right,

716
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:34,274
we should be able
to wake the Entities up.

717
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:36,901
You said that
that would be bad.

718
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:39,195
If we wake them up,
they might stay awake.

719
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:43,867
This could put an end
to Marco once and for all.

720
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:50,498
 

721
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:41,526
Veer off!

722
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:02,589


723
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:09,554
 

724
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:26,321
Aah!

725
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:30,199


726
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:37,206
 

727
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:56,976
 War doesn't end
on the battlefield.

728
00:48:56,976 --> 00:49:00,480
It ends
at the negotiating table,

729
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,440
or it doesn't end at all.

730
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,653
We all agree we must control
traffic through the Rings.

731
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:09,322
No one is opposed to the idea
of a transport union.

732
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:11,282
- Not even me.
-  Then why are we

733
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,951
still sitting here?
The longer we dither,

734
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:17,413
the more time we give
what's left of the Free Navy

735
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:19,957
to gather themselves
and reorganize.

736
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,709
We need to put something out.

737
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,169
Put what out?

738
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:27,298
A statement, our commitment
to collective action.

739
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:30,593
The United Nations,
Mars, and the Belt

740
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:32,595
have formed a new authority

741
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:35,556
to administer trade
to the Ring colonies.

742
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:39,310
Old enemies, new friends
are working together

743
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:43,147
to ensure the entities
inside the Rings

744
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:45,400
do not obliterate us all.

745
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,818
Put this out.

746
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:49,487
Belters will control the
traffic through the Ring Space.

747
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,072
Oh God, here we go again.

748
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:53,157
An authority with two Inner
votes and only one

749
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:55,576
for the Belt isn't sharing
power... it's a puppet show.

750
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:57,620
I take great offense to that.
You have no right...

751
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,080
 Prime minister.

752
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:05,586
You need to be reasonable.

753
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,922
I will not be reasoned
back into my place.

754
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:10,049
Belters are promised a future

755
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:12,343
so long as it remains
convenient.

756
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:15,763
We are given a voice so long
as Inners control the comm.

757
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:18,433
We have a vote so long
as we can always be voted down.

758
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:20,309
Easy.
We're just talking here.

759
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:22,854
Don't tell me to calm down.

760
00:50:22,854 --> 00:50:25,523
I'm tired of being talked at.

761
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:29,360
You control a faction,
the most important one, yes,

762
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,320
but you're not a government.

763
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,656
Half of the stations
in the Belt

764
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:36,409
and the Outer Planets
sided with Inaros.

765
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:39,871
You cannot expect us
to reward them.

766
00:50:39,871 --> 00:50:44,876
What I expect is for you to
reward me and every last Belter

767
00:50:44,876 --> 00:50:47,545
who took up arms
against Inaros to help you.

768
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:48,755

Mars will never accept

769
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:50,006
Belter control
of the Ring colonies.

770
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:51,299

The government would fall

771
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:53,342
if I even proposed
the debate in Parliament.

772
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:56,137
I give you my word
that you and your people

773
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:57,680
will be represented.

774
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,516
Equal status and dignity
to Mars and Earth.

775
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:02,393
 That promise has been
made and broken

776
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:03,853
more times than I can count.

777
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:06,147
Over and over we have been
told we can trust the Inners,

778
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:08,733
that this time will be
different, and it never was.

779
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:11,444
I cannot unwind history.

780
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:14,071
The Belt will treat you
with respect.

781
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,490
You have my word.

782
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:18,242
We will take our niche in
the future and allow you yours.

783
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:19,744
You have my word.

784
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:22,747
Is that good enough?
Will you take that?

785
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:28,711
Why is your word enough for me
and mine not enough for you?

786
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:31,214
We're going around
in circles.

787
00:51:40,473 --> 00:51:42,350
Inaros wasn't all wrong.

788
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:47,438
He was evil,

789
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:50,233
and he was cruel, but he tapped
into something real.

790
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:51,776
He was able to do what he did

791
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:54,612
because so many people
were angry and frightened.

792
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:57,114
They saw the future,
and they weren't in it.

793
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,492
- That's what this has to fix.
- You agree with her.

794
00:51:59,492 --> 00:52:00,952
You wanna show someone
you trust them,

795
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:02,286
you put your life
in their hands.

796
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,121
You can't just pretend to.

797
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,499
If you can't do that,
you don't really trust them.

798
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:09,126
And if we can't find a way to
trust each other at this point,

799
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,670
I doubt we ever will.

800
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:22,348
What if this transport union
were an independent agency

801
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:26,102
based in Medina Station, headed
by someone with no allegiances,

802
00:52:26,102 --> 00:52:28,145
a friend of the Belt.

803
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,522
An Inner?

804
00:52:29,522 --> 00:52:32,316
It would have to be
a unanimous choice of Earth,

805
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,735
Mars, and the Belt, of course.

806
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:37,029
A person above reproach,

807
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:40,241
apolitical, with a history

808
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:44,495
of working honorably
with all sides.

809
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:51,502
 

810
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,588
- Wait a minute.
-  James.

811
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:57,466
It's time for you
to make history again.

812
00:52:57,466 --> 00:53:04,473
 

813
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:16,944
I might be open to it
with certain assurances

814
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:20,323
that would have to be
guaranteed in writing.

815
00:53:20,323 --> 00:53:24,243


816
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:26,329
More coffee.

817
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:33,711
 Finally,
and most importantly,

818
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:37,298
the transport union
will be truly independent,

819
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:40,676
not beholden
to any government or faction,

820
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:43,429
its members compelled
by law to enforce

821
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,222
and abide by its decisions.

822
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:48,392
This union will allow us
to use the Rings safely

823
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,436
and share
their benefits with all.

824
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:54,190


825
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,067
I want to thank
the UN General Assembly

826
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:58,444
and the Martian Parliament
for their vision, courage,

827
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:02,323
and the speed with which
they ratified the charter.

828
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:06,702
I'm proud and humbled
to accept this position

829
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:09,872
as the first President
of the Transport Union.

830
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:12,416


831
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:17,880
Before I agreed
to take this job,

832
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,466
I insisted on a few conditions.

833
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:23,344
One of them
was that Camina Drummer

834
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:25,721
- would be vice president.
- 

835
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:28,182
A very wise woman I know
once said you shouldn't believe

836
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:31,060
what people say,
just watch what they do.

837
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,813
My first official acts
will define not only me,

838
00:54:33,813 --> 00:54:36,315
but the transport union itself.

839
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:39,777
This new union is gonna be
a critical part of our future,

840
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,320
a future
that for the first time

841
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,990
the Belt will truly share in.

842
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:45,241
I'm not a Belter.

843
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:46,867
I'm just a man from Earth,

844
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:50,579
representing people I respect
and sometimes love.

845
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:54,333
An outsider,
and I always will be

846
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:56,043
and there's a problem
with that.

847
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:57,628

Don't you fucking do it.

848
00:54:57,628 --> 00:55:01,257
Which is why,
as my first official act

849
00:55:01,257 --> 00:55:03,426
as President
of the Transport Union,

850
00:55:03,426 --> 00:55:05,136
I resign.

851
00:55:05,136 --> 00:55:07,930
The future of the Belt has
to speak with a Belter's voice,

852
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,306
and in that spirit,

853
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,183
I'm proud to introduce
the new President

854
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:14,186
of the Transport Union,
Camina Drummer.

855
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:17,565


856
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:25,865
One at a time, one at a time,
please, one at a time.

857
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:27,908
You duplicitous little shit.

858
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:29,201
It was the only way.

859
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:30,578

The two of you planned this.

860
00:55:30,578 --> 00:55:31,746
We had to.

861
00:55:31,746 --> 00:55:34,123
You were negotiating
in bad faith.

862
00:55:34,123 --> 00:55:35,416
I will undo this.

863
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:38,377
Don't.
Please don't even try.

864
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:40,171
It was the only way
to secure the peace,

865
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:42,840
the only way
we all move forward together.

866
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,176
And you know it.

867
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:47,678
crowd shouting questions
in background

868
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:57,855
 Oh, James.
I hope you're right.

869
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:23,380


870
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:30,387
 

871
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:02,628
 Just take it easy.
Get the feel.

872
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,505
The Roci's not the Razorback.

873
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:06,382

Don't worry, I'll be gentle.

874
00:57:06,382 --> 00:57:07,925
I promise.

875
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:14,056
I wonder what this button does.

876
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:16,142


877
00:57:16,142 --> 00:57:18,102
 Sure this is
a good idea, Cap?

878
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:20,563
The ride was rough enough
with you at the stick.

879
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:23,482
She's just messing with us,
I hope.

880
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:26,277
 Hey,
I made something for you.

881
00:57:30,823 --> 00:57:34,326
You'd still have the original
if you hadn't come visit me.

882
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:37,121
And I always liked it, so...

883
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:42,418
Did I get it right?

884
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:44,587
Yeah, I think you did.

885
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:09,778
I never thought
I'd see Inners take orders

886
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:11,822
from a Belter.

887
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,618
It's high time.

888
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:25,211
I pissed off
a lot of people.

889
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:27,546
You certainly did.

890
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:33,302
I hope I did
the right thing.

891
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:38,515
You did.

892
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,226
You followed your conscience

893
00:58:40,226 --> 00:58:43,729
in the hope that others
would follow theirs.

894
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:47,566
You didn't do it for a reward
or a pat on the head.

895
00:58:50,653 --> 00:58:56,784
The universe never tells us
if we did right or wrong.

896
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:59,995
It's more important
to try to help people

897
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:02,206
than to know that you did.

898
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:07,044
Take my station.

899
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:11,548
 More important that
someone else's life gets better

900
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:14,760
than for you to feel good
about yourself.

901
00:59:17,096 --> 00:59:19,723
You never know the effect
you might have on someone,

902
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:21,183
not really.

903
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:23,978
Maybe one core thing
you said haunts them forever.

904
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:29,566
Maybe one moment of kindness
gives them comfort or courage.

905
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:34,071
Maybe you said the one thing
they needed to hear.

906
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:36,532
It doesn't matter
if you ever know.

907
00:59:36,532 --> 00:59:39,576
You just have to try.

908
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:46,667
You are very wise.

909
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:49,211
I've lived a hard life.

910
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:56,260
 

911
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,220
There's gonna be
a lot of ships

912
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:01,515
heading for the Rings now.

913
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:03,183
Piracy will be an issue.

914
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:06,687
We could fly security
for freighters,

915
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:10,441
maybe get a consulting gig
on one of the colonies.

916
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,112
And we still don't know
what happened

917
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,530
to that protomolecule sample.

918
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:18,032
Sooner or later,
we're gonna have to...

919
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:20,784
Let's just stay here
for a minute.

920
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,536


921
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:28,667


922
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:35,090
 

923
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:49,521


924
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:56,570
